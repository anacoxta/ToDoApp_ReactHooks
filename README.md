# To-do list application

This is my first time using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).  
Let's see how this goes, shall we?

### Coding challenge

#### Main Features
- [x] O usuário deverá conseguir adicionar items
- [x] O usuário deverá conseguir marcar um item como feito
- [x] O usuário deverá conseguir desmarcar um item como feito
- [x] O usuário deverá conseguir diferenciar visualmente um item marcado à um item não marcado
- [ ] O usuário deverá conseguir filtrar os items por (Todos|Pendentes|Resolvidos)
- [x] Experiência do usuário fácil e direta.

#### Extra Features
- [x] **O uso de HOOKS**
- [x] **Persistência de dados no LocalStorage**
- [x] Aplicação com uma boa experiência
- [x] A possibilidade de excluir um item
- [x] A possibilidade de editar um item 
- [x] O uso do Git e organização de commits será um diferencial positivo.

### What's next?
* **URGENT: FILTER TASKS (ALL|PENDING|COMPLETED)**
* **URGENT: IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY**
* FIX URGENT BUG: 'Warning: Failed prop type: You provided a `checked` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler' (file Task.js)
* Fix CSS bug: hovering over one button triggers hover state of all buttons
* Add one more media query breakpoint (for tablets)
* Clean up CSS using variables (and maybe Sass) 
* Check cross-browser compatibility
* Check cross-platform compatibility
* Maybe make it a PWA?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
